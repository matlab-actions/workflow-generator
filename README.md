# Generate Starter Workflow for MATLAB

Use [GitHub&reg; Actions Workflow Generator for MATLAB](https://matlab-actions.github.io/workflow-generator/) to create a starter workflow for a repository that contains MATLAB&reg; code and Simulink&reg; models. You can use the generated workflow as a foundation for defining your own custom workflow.

To generate a starter workflow for your repository, in the workflow generation interface:

1. Enter your repository URL or GitHub username and repository. 
2. (Optional) Under **Advanced Options**, select one or more options to customize the workflow. 
3. Click **Generate Workflow**.

The workflow generator automatically displays the starter workflow in the workflow editor of your repository. Modify the generated workflow as needed, and commit your changes to save the workflow file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.

For more information about the available GitHub actions for MATLAB that you can use to define your workflow, see [Use MATLAB with GitHub Actions](https://github.com/matlab-actions).
